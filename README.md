#  Kritim Labs

*Building technology that thinks with you*

Welcome to the GitHub home of **Kritim Labs** — a creative studio building intelligent tools that honor human agency, memory, and creative expression.

We believe that code should feel more like poetry than machinery. We’re inspired by the quiet depth of nature, the mystery of the subconscious, and the craft of building things that matter.

This is where our projects live. Some are tools. Some are toys. All are made in the spirit of extending what it means to be human.

## 💡 Philosophy

We build systems at the intersection of design, intelligent sofware, and emotional technology. We draw more from folklore than from the Valley.

Kritim is a common misspelling of the Sanskrit word, *kritrim*, which means *artificial*.  
To us, it also means *crafted* by hand, with care.

We kept the typo because we believe imperfections carry meaning.
